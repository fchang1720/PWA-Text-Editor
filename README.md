# PWA-Text-Editor ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellowgreen) 


For this application, I created a text editor that stores and retrieves user input through the use of databases and caches.  
When a user opens the application, the editor should immediately be displayed, containing lines in which the user can enter inputs.  
This data is stored on the website browser storage. Furthermore, a user can install the editor onto his/her desktop and run it from there.  
Even if there isn't a connection or if the page gets refreshed, the editor will still be able to retrieve and display data that has been stored.  

## Technologies Used  

Webpack  
workbox  
idb  
babel-loader  
css-loader  
express  
concurrently  

Here are screenshots of my application in use:
